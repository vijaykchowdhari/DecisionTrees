    "# Introduction\n",
    "Decision trees are a powerful and popular machine learning technique. The basic concept is very similar to trees you may have seen commonly used to aid decision-making. The decision tree algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm -- we first construct the tree with historical data, and then use it to predict an outcome. One of the major advantages of decision trees is that they can pick up nonlinear interactions between variables in the data that linear regression can't\n",
    "\n",
    "This example uses decision trees to look at individual income in the US. The data is from the 1994 census, and contains information on an individual's marital status, age, type of work, and more. The target column, or what we want to predict, is whether individuals make less than or equal to 50k a year, or more than 50k a year."

Ultimately, we don't want this matrix, though -- we want one prediction per row in the training data. There are many ways to get from the output of multiple models to a final vector of predictions. One method is majority voting, in which each classifier gets a \"vote,\" and the most commonly voted value for each row \"wins.\" This only works if there are more than two classifiers (and ideally an odd number, so we don't have to write a rule to break ties). Majority voting is what we applied in the example above.\n",

If there's a .9 probability that the correct classification is 1, we can use the .9 as the value the classifier is predicting. This will give us a continuous output in a single vector, instead of just 0 or 1.\n",
